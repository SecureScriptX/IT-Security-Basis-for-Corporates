# Access Control

Implement policies, processes, and technologies to ensure that only authorized users are granted the minimum necessary privileges. There's no one-size-fits-all solution; adaptation is key, so we want to take it step by step.

## Password & MFA

Initiate protection at the basic level by implementing a password policy within your environment. In a Windows environment, this policy should be configured in the "Default Domain Policy" to cover all computers.

Whenever feasible, enhance security beyond password authentication using robust methods such as biometrics, one-time passwords, and application tokens. Multi-factor authentication (MFA), whether through SMS or application authenticator, is strongly recommended. Start with privileged users and progressively extend it to all users.

## Zero Trust

Identify and deactivate unused accounts, eliminate shared accounts, revoke unnecessary privileges, and enforce robust password policies.

## Audit of Account Usage

Regularly monitor and analyze user activity for unusual behavior, such as access attempts outside normal business hours or from unfamiliar locations. Aim to maintain less than 15% of accounts with "domain administrator" privileges in the fleet.
