# Inventory

Protecting your infrastructure requires understanding the devices connected to your network, the applications in use, user access permissions, and implemented security measures.

### What should your inventory contain and why?

As with all IT security concerns, maintaining a comprehensive inventory is essential. The inventory should include, at a minimum, the following information:

- Hardware details of each workstation and server
- Installed software with exact versions
- Date of the last report

# End-of-Life Equipment

Utilizing your inventory, identify equipment (both hardware and software) that has reached the end of its support. Unsupported equipment poses a security risk as it will no longer receive necessary patches. Exclude such equipment from your network. In extreme cases, a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) may perform a risk acceptance, which should be documented in the inventory. Regular reviews of this analysis are recommended, preferably with each new vulnerability discovery.

# Secure Boot

Ensure that secure boot is enabled on all compatible devices. This feature ensures that the computer only boots using manufacturer-approved software. With a decade of availability, standard usage should minimize any potential issues.

# Softwares List

To reduce the attack surface, establish a strict policy regarding authorized and unauthorized software within your company.

### Allowed Softwares

Utilize Group Policy Objects (GPO) or Intune to provide users with a readily available software library without requiring administrative rights. This helps prevent users from downloading installation programs independently, reducing the risk of downloading malicious software.

### Forbidden Softwares

Whether through Intune or AppLocker, block software identified as forbidden (either due to lack of legitimization or exposure to a dangerous Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [CVE] version). Any use of prohibited applications should be reported to the IT team.

# Security Hardening

Ensure your company follows proven hardening guides to configure devices. These guidelines may include:

- Station handover procedures with a prerequisite checklist
- Auditing the secure configuration of devices
- Alerts for configuration modifications

Implement hardening through tools like Ansible, GPO, or Intune.

# Antivirus / EDR

Deploy antivirus, and preferably Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), across your entire fleet, starting with critical business devices. Establish a monitoring system for generated alerts.
