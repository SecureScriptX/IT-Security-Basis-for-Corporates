# Phishing Prevention

Phishing attacks constitute one of the primary initial attack vectors, alongside the exploitation of vulnerabilities on your online servers.

## Antispam and Email Protection

- Do all emails received by your employees pass through a spam filter?
- Does your Antivirus (AV) software analyze attachments in emails?
- Is this configuration regularly reviewed and updated to address new threats?

## Analysis Procedure

In cases where an employee receives an email and harbors doubts, they should have the means to contact someone for a thorough analysis of the email.

## Phishing Drill

As phishing incidents can be perceived as direct attacks on the staff, it may be beneficial to conduct tests to ensure that your personnel is adequately aware of potential threats.
