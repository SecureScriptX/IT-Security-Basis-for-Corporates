Have you established a maximum update time for your workstations/servers/software? If yes, do you consider criteria such as the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score, whether the server to be patched is Internet-facing or not, and whether the vulnerability is known to be actively exploited (0-day)?
